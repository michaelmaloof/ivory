Capture photos from your phone and store them directly to TripTrunk

This is my first app using Swift and Amazon's cloud service. We're moving TripTrunk from Parse to Amazon and wanted to do a test run using Amazon before officially switching over. This is an unofficial TripTrunk app. 

I selected to do the app in Swift in case we ever wanted to move TripTrunk to Swift.
